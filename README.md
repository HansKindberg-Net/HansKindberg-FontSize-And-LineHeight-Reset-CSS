HansKindberg-FontSize-And-LineHeight-Reset-CSS
==============================================
CSS to reset font-size and line-height, eg. if you use some CSS framework that uses fixed/px font-size and line-height you can override it. To make sure all tags are being overridden, set the id of your html-tag to "html". If you want to override this css and use the html id, you probably need to use the id to force an override: * #html h1 { font-size: 2em; }.
